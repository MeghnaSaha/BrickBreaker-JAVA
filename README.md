# BrickBreaker-JAVA
The classic Brick Breaker Game coded in JAVA.

The Main.java class needs to be run in order to start the game.
The MapGenerator.java class creates the bricks and tracks whether they're hit. The GamePlay.java class is responsible for the physics of the game.

This is a simple GUI based game with the objective to bit as many bricks with the ball. The ball bounces on a paddle that may be moved with ARROW keys.
